# things i learnt from reading shoe dog

- sometimes you just need to take a step back from everything and contemplate what's going on
- taking breaks isn't a problem
- taking risks isn't a problem
- the people are what matters the most
- if you're determined, then the money will definitely come around eventually
- networking is really important
- you should base your approach towards finding solutions
- it's not embarrassing to accept your problems
- it's not embarrassing to ask for help
- the path upwards is an exponential one
- newfound appreciation for what it takes to start and succeed at a business
- starting a mega corporation like Nike might seem hard, but it's not all that difficult if you have the right people, the right mindset, and definitely some luck
- people who are 'bigger' than you can be your biggest ally or the cause of your hardship, so it's in your best interest to keep them happy until you become the bigger one
- newfound appreciation for Nike itself, but that's not anything I didn't have before, to be fair
